# Type theory lectures

This repo hosts the slides I have made to accompany my intermittent lectures on dependent type theory.

I am not a professor or anyone qualified to teach type theory; these lectures are entirely a learning tool for myself to better understand the theory (by teaching it to my mildly-interested friends).
For more correct and thorough reading material on type theory, please refer to the books I've based my lectures on:

* The [lecture notes](https://www.danielgratzer.com/courses/type-theory-s-2024/lecture-notes.pdf) of Carlo Angiuli and Daniel Gratzer's [course on Modern Dependent Type Theory](https://www.danielgratzer.com/courses/type-theory-s-2024/).
* _The_ Homotopy Type Theory book: [HoTT](https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/)

## Compiling
