- [x] Attributes: 'sequence', 'length of sequence', 'label'
- [x] Method to find whether input sequence is DNA/protein (based on type of character A/T/G/C belongs to DNA sequence, otherwise it is protein sequence.). Update attribute label as DNA/Protein
- [x] Method to compute Composition of sequence (dimer/trimer etc).
