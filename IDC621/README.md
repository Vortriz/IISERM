# IDC621 - Modelling Complex Systems

The course contained 4 different modules to explore various kinds of complex system. Here I describe the scope of my term paper for each module.

1. **Cellular Automata Models**: The work explores the classic [Abelian Sandpile Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_sandpile_model), its extension to infinite square grid, and computing the identity element. We also look at various ways to computationally optimize the grid stabilizations process.
2. **Oscillator Chains**: The work explores coupled oscillator model as described by [Kuramoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuramoto_model) and its extension to a 2D coupled lattice.
3. **Coupled Map Lattice**: We look at various 1D nonlinear maps, types of coupling, and the generation of different types of spatiotemporal chaos exhibited by combining these into [CMLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupled_map_lattice). Also, an unsuccessful attempt at simulating boiling liquid by the use of this CML framework :(
4. **Complex Networks**: We look at various [complex networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_network). The work also explores how a Kuramoto-like model can be combined with such networks to model opinion dynamics of a population!
